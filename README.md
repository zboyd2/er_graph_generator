# er_graph_generator
Quick, in-memory generation of Erdos-Renyi graphs with around a billion edges

Created for my personal experiments. Created an ER graph with N=365 million nodes and 1.2 billion edges in about 2 minutes on my desktop.

Contributions are welcome. This might be easy to upgrade to Dask and get even faster.
